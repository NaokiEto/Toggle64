Toggle64
========

This can parse JSON data for base 64 and VTK. For base 64, currently you can 
just put the JSON file in the directory and run the html file. For the vtk,
currently you can put the JSON file in the directory, along with the vtk file. 
Then, you can use the vtk to obj converter, and then the obj to JS (in JSON 
format) converter. Then you can run the html file.
